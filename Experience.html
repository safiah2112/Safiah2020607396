	<h3> MY OWN EXPERINECE </H3>
</center>



<center>
	<p>A litte bit of my experience during my school<br> 
when i in primary school, i was scared to come to school because<br> 
i don't have any friend and my mom not there.When i was 9 years old, <br>
i have a best friend and we active in co-curiculum. I joined because the teacher<br> 
that handle that is <sup> my favourite teacher.</sup></p>
</center>


<br>

<center>
	<p>In secondary school, i help my mom by sell a currypuff to my friend firstly.<br>
Thanks to them, my business going well until the discpline teacher told me that i can't sell that.<br>
Then, i tell my mom and we just follow but i can't keep quite so i sell to my first but not much.<br>
Suddenly, the teacher was also buy my currypuff and they let me sell it until form 5.<br>
I thankful to <sup> my teacher </sup> that always <sub> support bussiness </sub> and help the student that need a help.</p>
</center>


<br>


<center>
	<p>After finished SPM, teacher in my school also always make the order to my mom.<br>
Until now, they buy and helping my family and we thankfuly for who buy that.<br>
But right now, my mom can't do that anymore because my mom <sub> sick and weak </sub> to stand and sit for a long time.<br>
Eventhough, my mom do when my mom thinks of them and i'm proud of my mom.</p>
</center>


<br>


<center>
	<p>I never have a experience in working because family matter.<br>
But, i have other job that teach a student that need a help with certain subject such as tuition.<br>
Other than that, i always follow my mom friend to do a job that is a scallop for the wedding ceremony.<br>
Or not i will COD currypufs for teacher or my friend and with that i will get a money and experience.</p>
